# UI Element Detection using YOLOv7

This repository contains everything required for UI element detection using YOLOv7.

## Cloning Instructions
After cloning the repo move the dataset downloaded into the repo and trained weights are already there but if you want it to download then after downloading move it to the cloned repo at the same position where it is present in public drive link shared below.

## Dataset
The dataset, **UI-element-Detect-6**, is already downloaded preprocessed and i am sharing the drive link below . You can also download it [here](https://universe.roboflow.com/uied/ui-element-detect/dataset/6#).

## Trained Model Weights
The weights of the trained model after 2 epochs with a batch size of 16 are available at `runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt`. It's recommended to train the model for at least 20 epochs for better performance, but it wasn't trained beyond 2 epochs due to limited resources.

## Evaluation Images Results
The results on evaluation images of the dataset are available at `runs/detect/exp`.

## Colab Notebook
To execute the repository, refer to the Colab notebook file, `Training_YOLOv7_on_UI_Element_detection_Dataset.ipynb`, which contains all the necessary actions.

## Video Walkthrough
For an overview and walkthrough, watch the video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KVXE3TM1fPOUze0YBhTB7XIHOSySholn/view?usp=sharing).

## Since dataset, results and evaluation files are large i am pushing everything on the drive.... details sepcified below

## Folder Link
You can access the YOLOv7 folder containing the dataset, evaluation images, results, code everything [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10giALgHW5ut8JMJj2nFHS7x_dyiORZQQ?usp=sharing).

## Dataset Path
The dataset is available in the folder under **UI-element-Detect-6**.

## Test Set Results
The results on the test set of the dataset can be found at **runs/detect/exp2** within the folder.

## Evaluation Images Results
The results on evaluation images are located at **runs/detect/exp** within the folder.

## Trained Model Weights
The trained weights of the model are stored at **runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt** within the folder.
