# Figma_Image_Object_Detection
This repository contains everything required
# * UI-element-Detect-6, is the dataset which is already present and this is the download link  [Dataset] (https://universe.roboflow.com/uied/ui-element-detect/dataset/6#)
# * weights of the Trained Model on 2 epochs and batch size 16 (Recommended that you train the model to atleast 20 epochs, didn't trained because of limited resources of colab) path -> runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt
# * Result on test set of the datset, path-> runs/detect/exp2
# * Result on evaluation Images of the datset, path-> runs/detect/exp
This is the colab notebook file, Training_YOLOv7_on_UI_Element_detection_Dataset.ipynb which contains all the necessary action to execute the repo.
